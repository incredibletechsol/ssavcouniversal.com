                        As  mini-mills expand their product abilities to sheet steel, they require much  higher grades of scrap to approach the quality of output from integrated mills.  DRI enables mini-mills to use iron ore without having a blast furnace. It  serves as a low residual raw material and alleviates the mini-mills&rsquo; dependence  on cleaner, higher priced scrap. </span><p></td>

Revert  scrap is steel waste produced and recycled within a steelworks. New production  of steel scrap is generated when steel is cut and formed during the manufacturing of  finished products or components. The steel scrap is returned to steelworks and  foundries. <br>
Ferrous  scrap is mainly used in electric arc furnace steelmaking. About 500 million tonnes  of scrap are melted each year.</span><p></td>
